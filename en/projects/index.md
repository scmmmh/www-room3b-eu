15,000 objects from the Victoria & Albert Museum's digital collections.

exhibition built to acompany a physical exhibition around the topic of stones
through history and literature.

## Explore the Stacks

can be combined with search to enable an integrated experience. In the
application a collection of approximately 30,000 books from the British Library
and their illustrations can be explored.

## Under the Surface

The Under the Surface archive aimed to build an archive to surface authors, composers,
and artists who for one reason or another have slipped under the surface of public
perception. It does not hold any data itself, but uses automated tools to link together
data from a variety of sources.

## The Old Joke Archive

The Old Joke Archive aimed to build a digital archive of historic jokes published
in books, newspapers, and other materials. The archive will be accompanied by a
suite of tools to aid with the transcription, classification, and annotation of
the jokes and also to support complex analysis of the jokes and the way ideas
and punchlines travel between jokes.

## Gutzkow Digital Edition

The [Gutzkow Digital Edition](https://gutzkow.de) is a digital edition of the works
of 19th century author Karl Gutzkow. It includes modern web-based applications for
user-friendly editing and reading of the digital edition.

## Experiment Support System

The Experiment Support System is a python-based web-application for building
online surveys, questionnaire's, and crowdsourcing-style experiments. The project
has completed in its current form, but a simpler, more maintainable version
is currently in development.

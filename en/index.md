# Mark Hall

I am a Lecturer in Computing & Communication at The Open University. There I undertake research in a number of
area including Interactive Information Retrieval, Digital Cultural Heritage, and Digital Humanities. Outputs of these
can be seen in the projects list.

## Interests & Skills

My primary research interest lies in using computational methods, algorithms, and tools to help researchers
from other disciplines and non-academic partners understand and work with their data. Due to this I  have built up a
broad portfolio of skills, that allow me to pick the most appropriate method and tool for a given research problem.

## My background

I received my PhD in 2011 for research undertaken at Cardiff University's School of Computer Science and Informatics
for research into translating between natural language and computational representations of space. Since then I have
worked at a range of institutions including The National Archives, the University of Sheffield, Edge Hill
University, the Martin-Luther-University of Halle-Wittenberg, and The Open University on a range of collaborative,
interdisciplinary research projects, working both with other academics and external partners.
